     <p>Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer (both born February 15, 1984), known professionally as the Duffer Brothers, are American film and television writers, directors, and producers. They created the science fiction-horror series Stranger Things, wrote and directed the 2015 horror film Hidden, and have written episodes for Wayward Pines. They are twin brothers and have had a close relationship since childhood. They work on all of their projects as a duo</p>

<p>After writing and/or directing a number of short films, the Duffer Brothers script for the post-apocalyptic horror film Hidden was acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures in 2011. The brothers directed the film in 2012, which was released in 2015. Director M. Night Shyamalan read the script and hired them as writer/producers on the Fox television series Wayward Pines.</p>

<p>
    The Duffer Brothers were born and raised in Durham, North Carolina. They began making films in the third grade using a Hi8 video camera that was a gift from their parents. They attended the Duke School for Children from grades K-8, a private suburban school, and then the Charles E. Jordan High School, a large Durham public school. They relocated to Orange, California, to study film at Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, where they graduated in 2007.  
</p>


<p>Ross Duffer married director Leigh Janiak in Palm Springs in December 2015. The couple met in 2006 at a production company in Los Angeles, where she was an assistant to the producer and he was an intern. According to media reports, Matt is dating Stranger Things department head hairstylist and makeup artist Sarah Hindsgaul.</p>
<p>In March 2018, the Duffer Brothers were accused of verbal abuse on the Stranger Things set by a grip who worked on the show. The crew member stated on social media that she would not return for Season 3 because the Duffer Brothers created a hostile work environment for women. The brothers strongly denied this claim and an investigation by Netflix found no wrongdoing. The brothers had previously been criticized for coaxing teenage actress Sadie Sink into performing an unscripted kiss scene. However, Sink said she did not object.
